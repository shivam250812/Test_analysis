Let's dive into the specifics to see how we can build on your successes and address areas for growth.


**Performance Breakdown**

| Subject       | Score | Attempted | Accuracy |
|---------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Physics       | 44/100 | 16/25      | 75%       |
| Chemistry     | 60/100 | 20/25      | 80%       |
| Mathematics   | 29/100 | 11/25      | 72.7%     |

| Difficulty | Total | Attempted | Accuracy | Avg Time (seconds) |
|------------|-------|------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Easy        | 25    | 19         | 73.7%     | 121.4              |
| Medium      | 30    | 18         | 77.8%     | 64.0               |

**Time vs. Accuracy Insights**

Your accuracy is consistently good across difficulty levels, suggesting a strong understanding of the material. However, you spent a significantly longer time on easy questions (121.4 seconds) compared to medium (64 seconds) and tough (52.3 seconds) questions.  This suggests you might be overthinking simpler problems or lacking efficient problem-solving strategies for easier questions. Focus on quicker approaches to basic problems to free up more time for challenging ones.  In Mathematics, the longer time spent per question, especially in Functions and Sets and Relations, might indicate a need for more practice and a clearer strategy.


**Chapter-wise Concept Analysis**

* **Physics:**
    * **Electrostatics:** Strong in most areas but needs improvement in Coulomb's Law and Charged Particle in an electric field.
    * **Capacitance:**  Strong in most areas; needs focused practice on Multiple dielectric slabs and Force on plates.

* **Chemistry:**
    * **Solutions:** Strong in many areas but needs improvement in Osmotic pressure and Depression in freezing point.
    * **Electrochemistry:** Surprisingly strong despite low attempt rate.  Explore more questions in this chapter.

* **Mathematics:**
    * **Functions:** Strong in some areas, but weak in determining one-to-one and onto functions, finding composite functions, and periodic functions.
    * **Sets and Relations:** Mostly strong; focus on Symmetric, Transitive, and Reflexive properties.


**Actionable Suggestions**

1. **Time Management Strategy:** Practice timed tests focusing on improving speed on easier questions. Use the time saved to tackle more challenging problems effectively.  Try techniques like eliminating obviously wrong answers first to save time.

2. **Targeted Concept Review:** Create a focused study plan addressing the weak concepts identified above. Use practice problems and different resources to understand these concepts thoroughly.  For example, start with Coulomb's Law in Physics and Osmotic pressure in Chemistry.

3. **Increase Attempt Rate:** Your attempt rate is relatively low.  While accuracy is important, attempting more questions will increase your overall score, even if some are incorrect. Aim to attempt at least 65-70% of the questions in future tests.  Build confidence by practicing more questions from weak areas.
